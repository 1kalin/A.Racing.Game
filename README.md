# A.Racing.Game

I am very passionate about games and would love to get involved into developing a modern racing game from driving physics to artificial intelligence. I chose to propose my own project, which I would extremely enjoy working on.
The project is about creating a modern racing game, emphasising on modern driving physics and artificial intelligence techniques. The general idea is to create a fully-playable game with two cars and one track to choose from. Knowledge from courses COMP24111 and COMP27112 can be beneficial.
Unity is a game engine that lays on top of APIs like OpenGL and DirectX. It is a whole development environment which allows you to code in C# or JavaScript. The application could be exported for a variety of systems. Android is one of them. Unity also handles game level design and figures out how to render the environment and also plays music. 
Things that need to be implemented are:
•	car handling;
•	forces, torque, aerodynamic drag, brake force;
•	track navigation; 
•	strategic driving;
•	obstacle avoidance; 

My name is Kalin Smolichki and I propose this project. I believe that it is an ambitious project and would take a deserved portion of my time. I would say that it is Moderate and a bit Hard. I also think that this project will get me more involved into the libraries and technology that I am interested in.
